# Q-Lang
Source code for my Q Programming language. 

## Background

The Q Programming Language is a small, C-inspired general purpose language. The name for Q comes from *Star Trek: The Next Generation*. Q is an omnipotent being 
that creates mischief for the Enterprise crew. This language behaves in a similar manner: it may not do what you expect, and it certainly isn't helpful.

## Features

This language is still in its initial development stages. There is no currently working version. The hope is to eventually use the LLVM platform to help with code
generation and portability. This is a side-project and will receive attention when I have the bandwidth to give it.
